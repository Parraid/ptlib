## PTLib

This is a fork of PTLib 2.10.9 to keep a stable API for the H323Plus library and the GNU Gatekeeper. The main PTLib development branch makes substantial API changes with every version, while this branch keeps the API stable and only makes compatible changes wherever possible.

This fork is actively maintained to fix bugs and security issues.
